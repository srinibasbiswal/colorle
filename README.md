The user will select the number of blocks (n) he wants to play with (min. 4).  Once selected randomly generated n number of color blocks will be shown to the user which the user needs to arrange in a specific order which is randomly generated and only shown to the user if the user arranges in the same order.

The user can arrange in any order and can try any number of times. Once the user arranges and selects for check, if any color placed is matched with the randomly generated color, then the number of matched blocks will be displayed but the user will not be aware which colors are correct.

The aim is to guess the pattern with minimum number of tries.
